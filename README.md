# Overview

Number Guessing game made in Java

It is  game where you choose the range of the numbers to guess from, it chooses a random number and you try to guess the selected number in the least amount of tries.

I made this in order to try programming in Java and do so in a fun way.

I developed this using Java and the included libraries in Visual studio code.

# Future Work
Items I want to add in the future

- Item 1 Make it so that you only have a limited number of guesses before the game resets
- Item 2 Have a 2 player mode, each are trying to guess the same number
- Item 3 Have an option to guess multiple numbers in one round
